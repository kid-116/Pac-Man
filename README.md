# Pac-Man
This is an attempt to recreate the iconic arcade game Pac-Man using OOP concepts. The aim of the game is to gather as many points as possible with 3 lives. Points can be earned by clearing the map or going after the ghosts but be careful, ghosts can be eliminated only when you have taken a power-up.
